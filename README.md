# cs5610 final project
This is final project of Web Development Course  
Topic: Personal Review of Selected Movies  
Group member: Yuze Zhang  

## Introduction  
The website bases on selected movies from IMDB TOP-250, I select 30-50 favourite movies and give personal review for them.  
User could look through every webpage in my website and they could give their comments after logging in.

## Progress
Iteration 1: Construct the basis of website, connection between frontend and backend is not good and crash for profile/login webpage.  
Iteration 2: Solve problems in authentication and fetch from backend, update style of movie details, introduce new collection: comments for  
every login user who wants to give their comment on specific movie but still trying figure out how to push to this comment array.
